# Uno Card Game
This project is an implementation of the Uno card game in JavaScript. It was developed as part of my first project at Ironhack, where I had the opportunity to learn and apply my newly acquired JavaScript skills to create a fully functional game.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a JavaScript game using classes as a way to structure and organize the code. Uno, a popular card game known for its fast-paced gameplay and exciting twists, provided an excellent opportunity to practice object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript.

## Features
Interactive Gameplay: Play the Uno card game with intuitive and interactive gameplay.
Customizable Rules: Customize the game rules to suit your preferences or experiment with different variations of the game.
Multiple Players: Enjoy the game with friends or challenge computer-controlled opponents.
Visual Feedback: Visual cues and notifications provide feedback during the game, making it more engaging and enjoyable.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript Classes
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Open the index.html file in a web browser to start the game.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any bugs, have suggestions for improvements, or would like to add new features, please feel free to submit a pull request.

## Future updates
As I planned for some future updates is to implement the special cards known from a classic Uno Game. The content for the special cards are already implement and you can find them inside of the gameData.js, but they are commented out for know. It is also possible to add some aditional diffculites by changing the amount of cards the enemy or the Player receives. Another interesting feature wich could be implemented would be a coinflip option make a possible to play with another friend on the same computer.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the instructors and staff at Ironhack for their guidance and support throughout this project. Their expertise and resources were instrumental in helping me learn and develop my first JavaScript game.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this template to include any additional information or sections that you find relevant for your project. Good luck with your Uno card game project!
